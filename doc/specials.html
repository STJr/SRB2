<h1><big>SRB2 Specials Reference Document</big></h1>

<p><i>Last updated May 27, 2008</i></p>

<p><i>For v1.1 Private Beta</i></p>

<p>This is the SRB2 Specials Reference Document. It is designed to be the ultimate
reference for effects used in SRB2. As such, it is rather technical in areas and quite
concise, and is not something a beginner with level design should be dealing with.</p>

<h1><a name="things"></a>Thing Types</h1>

<p>In general, thing bitsets have 4 flags and 3 digits for their height. The bitset is
0xAAAB, where AAA is the object's height above ground, and B are the Easy, Normal, Hard,
and Deaf flags. To get the bitset on a normal object, multiply the height desired by 16,
and then add the existant B. Some objects use 32 as this number, and they will be noted.
Objects that multiply by 16 can be placed up to 4095 units in the air, while objects that
multiply by 32 can be placed up to 2047 units in the air. 

<ul>
  <li><u><big><big>Player Starts</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="t1"></a>1 - Player 01 Start</h3>
      <p>This is the start for the first player in single player mode, cooperative mode, or race
      mode. This start must be placed on every map, as it is what the game defaults to if the
      start it is attempting to find isn't there. If there is no Player 1 Start on the map, and
      the game is confused over where to spawn the player, the game will crash outright.</p>
      <p>The Deaf tag will make the player spawn from the ceiling, and the object needs to be
      multiplied by 32 to give height, not 16.</p>
      <h3><a name="t2"></a>2 - Player 02 Start</h3>
      <p>This is the start for the second player in cooperative and race mode.</p>
      <p>The Deaf tag will make the player spawn from the ceiling, and the object needs to be
      multiplied by 32 to give height, not 16.</p>

      <p>This is the start for players in Match and Chaos modes. They should also be placed in
      Capture the Flag maps as well. There should be 32 of these in a map to assure proper
      randomization. While it's unelegant, they can be stacked on top of each other without
      negative effect.</p>

  <li><u><big><big>Enemies</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="t100"></a>100 - Crawla (Blue)</h3>
      <p>These are the blue ground enemies found in the one player stages. They can't move off
      of cliffs and are exceedingly slow.</p>
      <h3><a name="t101"></a>101 - Crawla (Red)</h3>
      <p>These are the red ground enemies found in the one player stages. They can't move off
      cliffs and are relatively slow.</p>
      <h3><a name="t102"></a>102 - Stupid Dumb Unnamed RoboFish (tm)</h3>
      <p>This is the little fish in Greenflower Zone. The angle determines the jump height, with
      0 being the old jump style. Note that the jump height is based on force, not units, so
      experimentation will be necessary to get the correct height.</p>
      <h3><a name="t103"></a>103 - Yellow Buzz</h3>
      <p>This enemy flies at a moderate speed directly at the player.</p>
      <h3><a name="t104"></a>104 - Red Buzz</h3>

      <h3><a name="t105"></a>105 - Jetty-Syn Bomber</h3>
      <p>This is a highly mobile flying enemy with a bomb that it drops on the player from
      directly above. It is considered highly difficult to kill, and should only be used in
      situations where the stage is supposed to be difficult.</p>
      <h3><a name="t106"></a>106 - Jetty-Syn Gunner</h3>
      <p>This is a highly mobile flying enemy with a gun that it fires at the player with high
      accuracy. It is considered highly difficult to kill, and should only be used in situations
      where the stage is supposed to be difficult.</p>

      <p>This is the grey floating enemy in the opening room of Techno Hill Zone Act 2. It is
      quite fast and will start bouncing after taking the first hit. It is significantly
      challenging, although a spindash will kill it given time.</p>
      <h3><a name="t108"></a>108 - Deton</h3>
      <p>This is the red spherical enemy in Techno Hill Zone Act 2. Upon seeing the player, it
      makes a mad dash straight for them. With the exception of the <a href="#t404">Armageddon
      Shield</a>, Detons are invincible, and must be avoided by running behind a wall or another
      enemy.</p>
      <h3><a name="t109"></a>109 - Skim</h3>
      <p>This is an enemy that floats on the surface of the water, dropping bombs into the water
      below. It is not currently used in any of the Single Player stages, but it is fully
      operational. The designer does not have to put them on the surface of the water, they know
      where it is.</p>
      <h3><a name="t110"></a>110 - THZ Turret</h3>
      <p>This is the turret from Techno Hill Zone Act 2. It fires large bursts of laser fire at
      the player with high accuracy. It is invincible unless it is somehow dipped into water.</p>
      <h3><a name="t111"></a>111 - Popup Turret</h3>
      <p>This is a small turret that pops up now and then and shoots. The object's angle is a
      value defining the delay between shooting.</p>
      <h3><a name="t112"></a>112 - Sharp</h3>
      <p>This is a blue enemy with spikes on top if it. It starts off by slowly chasing the player,
      then it fades to red and runs after the player, and is invincible until it fades back to red.</p>
      <h3><a name="t113"></a>113 – Jet Jaw</h3>
      <p>This is an underwater enemy that tries to bite at the player, which can be found in
      Deep Sea Zone.</p>
      <h3><a name="t114"></a>114 – Snailer</h3>
      <p>This is an incomplete enemy.</p>
      <h3><a name="t115"></a>115 – Bird Aircraft Strike Hazard (B.A.S.H.)</h3>
      <p>This is the red vulture-like enemy in Arid Canyon Zone. If it sees a player, it lifts off and
      charges at him. Collision with a wall will send it plummeting.</p>
      <h3><a name="t116"></a>116 – Pointy</h3>
      <p>This is the orbinaut enemy that has spikes circling around it. None of the single player stages
      currently use him. You have to place him in a map by using a WAD editor, he can't be placed using
      objectplace.</p>
      <h3><a name="t117"></a>117 – Robo-Hood</h3>
      <p>This is the green enemy from Castle Eggman Zone, which shoots arrows at the player.</p>
      <h3><a name="t118"></a>118 – CastleBot FaceStabber</h3>
      <p>This is the large grey enemy from Castle Eggman Zone. It slowly trudges towards the player,
      and if the player in range, lunges at them with his sword.</p>
      <h3><a name="t119"></a>119 – Egg Guard</h3>
      <p>This is the enemy from Castle Eggman Zone that wields a protective shield.</p>
      <h3><a name="t120"></a>120 – Green Snapper</h3>
      <p>This is the green turtle enemy from Arid Canyon Zone. This enemy behaves exactly like a blue
      crawla does. The circumference of its shell is covered with spikes, so the only way to destroy it
      is by jumping on top of it.</p>
      <h3><a name="t121"></a>121 – Minus</h3>
      <p>This is the digging enemy from Arid Canyon Zone. It burrows underground towards the player, and
      once it's directly underneath, it bursts out from under the ground, jumping up and hurting the player.</p>

      <p>The boss of Greenflower Zone and Castle Eggman Zone. He moves around firing at the
      player, and after taking six hits, he dashes at the player.</p>
      <p>Giving the boss the Deaf flag will make him have spikeballs, like CEZ3, and giving him
      the Multi flag will make the level end when he is dead. To place him above ground,

      <p>This is the boss of Techno Hill Zone. It requires an axis point at the center to
      function, and it goes in a circle around the axis point dropping slime. After 6 hits, he
      stops going in a circle, and bouncing at the player, spewing a lot more slime.</p>

      <h3><a name="t404"></a>404 - Armageddon Shield</h3>
      <p>Also known as the black shield, this shield protects the player from a single hit,
      triggering upon a hit. The shield can also be triggered by jumping, and then hitting the
      spin key in midair. When the shield is triggered, a flash of light damages everything
      within a large radius, destroying the shield in the process.</p>

      randomly which replenish the player's air.</p>
      <h3><a name="t501"></a>501 - End Level Sign</h3>
      <p>This is the sign at the end of the stage. When the player enters the <a href="#s8192">Exit
      Sector</a>, this sign will start to spin, and end on the face of the player. This sign
      does not make the stage end, it's just a visual effect for it.</p>
      <h3><a name="t502"></a>502 - Star Post</h3>
      <p>Star Posts allow the player to respawn after dying at a point other than the beginning
      of the stage. There can be up to 32 Star Posts in a map, and they work with the bitsets.</p>
      <p>Instead of controlling the difficulty and deaf flags, the final digit of the bitset
      determines the number of the Star Post. 0x0000 is the first one and 0x000f is the
      sixteenth one. Note that since this overwrites all of the difficulty flags, they will
      appear in all difficulties, even though 0x0000 would normally mean it wouldn't appear in
      any difficulty level.</p>

      <h3><a name="t522"></a>522 - Ceiling Spike</h3>
      <p>This is a downward pointing spike for use on the ceiling. Touching the pointy end of
      the spike deals damage to the player.</p>
      <p>By default, it attaches itself to the ceiling, and the height part of the bitset
      measures how far down from the ceiling, instead of up from the floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="t523"></a>523 - Floor Spike</h3>
      <p>This is a upward pointing spike for use on the floor. Touching the pointy end of the
      spike deals damage to the player.</p>

      <h3><a name="t540"></a>540 - THZ Fan</h3>
      <p>This is the fan used inside the secret passage in Techno Hill Zone Act 1. It pushes the
      player slowly up until it reaches the maximum height it can. The maximum height is
      determined by the angle, measured in normal fracunits (It can go above 360 just fine).</p>
      <h3><a name="t541"></a>541 - THZ Gas Jet</h3>

      <p>This is the fireball used in Mario Koopa Blast 3. The angle determines the jump height,
      with 0 being the old jump style. Note that the jump height is based on force, not units,
      so experimentation will be necessary to get the correct height.</p>
      <h3><a name="t1806"></a>1806 - King Bowser</h3>
      <h3><a name="t1807"></a>1807 - Axe</h3>
      <p>The axe used to defeat Bowser in the third Mario level.</p>
      <h3><a name="t1808"></a>1808 - Bush (Short)</h3>
      <p>This is a scenery object from Mario Koopa Blast</p>

      <h3><a name="t1851"></a>1851 - Candy Cane</h3>
      <p>X-Mas scenery object. Looks like a candy cane.</p>
      <p>Note that Mystic Realm 4 replaces this object with the Sonic 1 palm tree, so any maps
      loaded while Mystic Realm 4 is loaded will overwrite the image, making any candy canes
      look like palm trees, which can look kinda stupid.</p>
      <h3><a name="t1852"></a>1852 - Snowman</h3>
      <p>X-Mas scenery object. Pushable snowman with a happy face. Can be stood on top of as

  <li><u><big><big>Level Parameters / Miscellany</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="l1"></a>1 - Per-Sector Gravity</h3>
      <p>Sets the gravity of the tagged sector or sectors, as a percentage of global gravity
      (which can be set separately using sector type <a href="#s176">176</a>). The floor height
      of the control sector is used. If it is 1000, then the target sector will have 100%
      gravity. If it is 500, the target sector will have 50% of the global gravity. Negative
      values work as well, but players can't jump down; they'll get stuck to the ceiling, unless
      the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is checked.</p>
      <p>You can apply this special to the control sector of an intangible FOF to change the
      gravity only inside that FOF.</p>
      <h3><a name="l2"></a>2 - Custom Exit</h3>
      <p>Tag this to an Exit Sector (type <a href="#s8192">8192</a>) to exit to a custom level,
      overriding the one set in the map header. The map number you go to is indicated by the
      front sector's floor. Additionally, if the control linedef's bitset is set to disallow
      climbing (with the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> attribute, whose value is 64), skip the
      score tally screen when switching to the new map.</p>
      <p>If the control linedef has the <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag set,
      this effect does something super complicated and fun, going to a different level depending
      on whether the player has all emeralds or not. If the player has seven emeralds, the
      linedef's front sector's ceiling height will be used. Otherwise, go to the map number
      indicated by the linedef's front sector's floor. That's <i>only</i> if you set the <a
      href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag.</p>
      <p>If the <a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> flag is set, the linedef's front side x offset
      will be used as the new gametype after the map change, providing it is in range (from 0 to
      4, inclusive).</p>
      <h3><a name="l3"></a>3 - Zoom Tube Parameters</h3>
      <p>X length = speed. Y length = waypoint sequence #. See sector type <a href="#s32768">32768</a>
      for more information.</p>
      <h3><a name="l4"></a>4 - Speed Pad</h3>
      <p>Creates a speed pad. The linedef direction and indicates the direction of the pad. The
      target sector must have type <a href="#s1280">1280</a> or <a href="#s1536">1536</a> for
      this to work.</p>
      <p>If the <a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> flag is set, you will not be teleported to the
      center of the sector when the speed pad is activated.</p>
      <h3><a name="l5"></a>5 - Camera Scanner</h3>
      <p>Modifies camera position while the player is in the target sector. The floor and
      ceiling of the control sector and the angle of the control linedef are the values for
      CAM_HEIGHT, CAM_DIST, and CAM_ROTATE, respectively. Camera position is reset when the
      player steps outside the sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l6"></a>6 - Disable Linedef</h3>
      <p>Disables any linedef specials that share the same tag. Will be used in the future to
      check if a particular level has been previously cleared or not.</p>
      <h3><a name="l7"></a>7 - Flat Alignment</h3>
      <p>Aligns floor and/or ceiling flats. The x alignment is specified by the control
      linedef's x distance (the difference between the x values of its two vertices), and the y
      alignment is specified by the control linedef's y distance.</p>
      <p>By default, works on both the floor and ceiling (however, note that skies cannot be
      &quot;aligned&quot; ;). Adding the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag to the linedef will
      align the floor only, while the <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag will make
      it align the ceiling only.</p>
      <h3><a name="l8"></a>8 - Sector Special Parameters</h3>
      <p>Sets special behavior of a sector's type depending on the flag(s) checked:</p>
      <p><a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> - Special only operates when touching ceiling</p>
      <p><a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> - Special operates when touching either the floor or the
      ceiling</p>
      <p><a href="#EFFECT3">EFFECT3</a> - Special operates by just touching the sector, rather
      than having to be inside of it.</p>
      <h3><a name="l9"></a>9 - Chain Parameters</h3>
      <p>Sets special behavior of a moving chain as such:</p>
      <p>x length - # of links on the chain</p>
      <p>y length - Overall speed (0-15)</p>
      <p>X offset - Rotation speed on the X axis (0-15)</p>
      <p>Y offset - Rotation speed on the Z axis (0-15)</p>
      <p>floorheight - angle to start at (0-15)</p>
      <p>ceilingheight - maximum rotation speed</p>
      <h3><a name="l10"></a>10 - Culling Plane</h3>
      <p>Set like <a href="#l1">line 1</a>, this creates an invisible plane in the sector. If
      your view is above this plane, lots of things drawn below the height of this plane will be
      discarded, and if your view is below the plane, a lot of things drawn above the height of
      the plane will be discarded. This is to tell the game to not draw stuff that you aren't
      going to see anyway. Do note that the view doesn't have to be in the current sector, you
      can also be viewing from the side, which may be undesirable. To prevent this problem, you
      can check the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, which will allow you to 'group' a set
      of sectors to one control sector in which the culling will only take effect. For example,
      you have a control sector set up for culling, and have two culling lines in the control
      sector, tagged to sectors 'A' and 'B'. If the player is in sector 'A' or 'B', the culling
      will occur, but if the player is in sector 'C', it will not.</p>
      <h3>11 - Rope Hang Parameters</h3>
      <p>X length = speed. Y length = waypoint sequence #.</p>
      <p>EFFECT1 - Don't wrap movement</p>
      <p>See sector type 45056 for more information.</p>
      <h3>12 - Rock Spawn Parameters</h3>
      <p>Sets special behavior of a rock spawner (#1202) as such:</p>
      <p>length - momentum strength</p>
      <p>line angle - momentum angle</p>
      <p>X offset - # of tics to wait until another is spawned</p>
      <p>Y offset - Rock crumble sprite to use (0-15)</p>
      <p>NOCLIMB - add some randomization to the momentum</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>13 - Heat Wave</h3>
      <p>Applies a heat effect to the screen. Tag this to a sector, or to the control sector of a FOF.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </ol>

  <li><u><big><big>Level-Load Effects</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="l50"></a>50 - Instant Floor Lower</h3>
      <p>Makes the floor instantly lower on level load to be at the same height as the lowest
      floor of any bordering sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l51"></a>51 - Instant Ceiling Raise</h3>
      <p>Makes the ceiling instantly rise on level load to be the same height as the highest
      ceiling of any bordering sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l52"></a>52 - Continuously Falling Sector</h3>
      <p>Requires two control sectors. Sector continuously falls until its ceiling reaches the
      floor of the line's back sector, then returns to its original position and keeps falling.
      Linedef length determines speed. Good for things like intermittently falling lava. If the <a
      href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is set, it falls upwards, instead of downwards.</p>
      <h3><a name="l53"></a>53 - Continuous Floor/Ceiling Mover</h3>
      <p>Must be a two-sided linedef, tagged to another sector on the map. The tagged sector's
      floor and ceiling will move, first so that they're equal to the floor and ceiling of the
      linedef's front sector, then so they're equal to the floor and ceiling of the linedef's
      back sector, then the front sector again, and so on.</p>
      <p>The speed of the movement is determined by the linedef's length and uses the same units
      as linetype <a href="#l60">60</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="l54"></a>54 - Continuous Floor Mover</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l53">53</a>, but only moves the floor, not the ceiling. Can be
      used to replace floating platforms in some cases, where only the floor was desired to
      move.</p>
      <h3><a name="l55"></a>55 - Continuous Ceiling Mover</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l53">53</a>, but only moves the ceiling, not the floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="l56"></a>56 - Continuous Two-Speed Floor/Ceiling Mover</h3>
      <p>Must be a two-sided linedef, tagged to another sector on the map. The tagged sector's
      floor and ceiling will move, first so that they're equal to the floor and ceiling of the
      linedef's front sector, then so they're equal to the floor and ceiling of the linedef's
      back sector, then the front sector again, and so on.</p>
      <p>The speed of the movement is determined by the linedef's x distance (the first way,
      towards the front sector) and y distance (the second way, towards the back sector), using
      the same units as linetype <a href="#l60">60</a>.</p>
      <p>Unlike linetype <a href="#l53">53</a>, this effect does not slow down when it reaches
      the end of its movement. Instead, it changes instantly from going in one direction to
      going in the other. It's designed for making more sophisticated crushers than the crusher
      type allows (i.e. crushers with varying rise/crush speeds, FOF crushers, crushers with
      different start points).</p>
      <h3><a name="l57"></a>57 - Continuous Two-Speed Floor Mover</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l56">56</a>, but only moves the floor, not the ceiling.</p>
      <h3><a name="l58"></a>58 - Continuous Two-Speed Ceiling Mover</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l56">56</a>, but only moves the ceiling, not the floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="l59"></a>59 - Activate Floating Platform</h3>
      <p>This is used to make floating platforms (that move up and down) as well as moving
      water. In fact, you can use this to make any type of block move vertically. The way it
      works is somewhat confusing - You use three control sectors, all connected by at least one
      linedef. Easiest thing to do is make three square sectors together in a row. One of the
      linedefs on the middle sector should contain the Floor Over Floor line special that you
      want. This will be the Floor Over Floor control sector. The other two sectors represent
      the bottommost position you want the Floor Over Floor to reach, and the topmost position
      you want the Floor Over Floor to reach. The 59 line can be on any of these sectors, as
      long as you tag it to the middle one. If you still don't understand, look at Greenflower
      Zone Act 2. If the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is set, the platform will begin
      moving upwards, rather than downwards.</p>
      <h3><a name="l60"></a>60 - Activate Floating Platform (Adjustable Speed)</h3>
      <p>Speed is indicated by linedef length; one unit of speed here is 0.25 fracunits per tic.
      (Floating platforms made with type <a href="#l59">59</a> move at 2 fracunits per tic.)
      Aside from the linedef length controlling speed, works exactly like linedef type <a
      href="#l59">59</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="l61"></a>61 - Crusher 1 (Ceiling to Floor)</h3>
      <p>The crush motion is from the ceiling to the floor. Linedef length indicates crusher
      speed. See also linetype <a href="#l62">62</a>, Crusher 2.</p>
      <h3><a name="l62"></a>62 - Crusher 2 (Floor to Ceiling)</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l61">61</a>, Crusher 1, except that it starts in a different
      place, not synchronised with any crushers that use the Crusher 1 type. The highest ceiling
      this crusher reaches will be the highest ceiling height of any bordering sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l63"></a>63 - Fake Floor</h3>
      <p>Creates two fake planes, fake floor and fake ceiling. Main textures are not affected,
      but as far as above/below textures and floor/ceiling flats are concerned, the floor and
      ceiling height are those of the control sector. As far as collisions, walking, etc. are
      concerned, the floor and ceiling flats are whatever they normally would be.</p>
      <p>Fake floor is useful for railings (THZRAIL and WOODRAIL; see THZ2 for examples) and
      snow effects (making a fake floor of snow just a few units above normal floor, so it looks
      like the player's feet are buried in the snow).</p>
      <h3><a name="l64"></a>64 - Appearing/Disappearing FOF</h3>
      <p>Tag this to any FOF <i>line</i> and this will cause it to appear and disappear
      intermittently. The line's X length is the amount of time (in tics) that the FOF will
      appear, and Y length is the amount of time (in tics) that the FOF will disappear. The
      control sector's floor height allows you to specify an offset (in tics) of how much time
      will pass before the appearing/disappearing kicks in.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <li><u><big><big>Floor-Over-Floors (FOFs)</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="l100"></a>100 - Floor Over Floor: Solid, Opaque, Shadowcasting</h3>
      <p>This is just a regular old FOF. As with any block, the ceiling of the control sector is
      the top of the block, and the floor of the control sector is the bottom.
      &quot;Shadowcasting&quot; means that the light value used in the control sector is used
      for the area below where the actual FOF appears, as opposed to above it.</p>
<!--Exact FOF flags:

      <h3><a name="l101"></a>101 - Floor Over Floor: Solid, Opaque, Non-Shadowcasting</h3>
      <p>See notes for <a href="#l100">100</a>. &quot;Non-shadowcasting&quot; means that the
      light value you set in the control sector will be used for the area above the FOF, instead

      <h3><a name="l102"></a>102 - Floor Over Floor: Solid, Translucent</h3>
      <p>Useful for windows. The GLASSTEX texture is good for this purpose. You can change the
      alpha value of the translucency by setting the control linedef's Above texture to a #
      followed by a three-digit decimal number, 000 to 255. #000 is most transparent, #255 is
      most opaque. Note that in software mode, there are actually only ten different values that
      serve as a 'best guess'.</p>

      <h3><a name="l103"></a>103 - Floor Over Floor: Solid, Sides Only</h3>
      <p>A solid FOF that renders sides only, not planes (floor and ceiling). You were supposed
      to be able to use it to place railings (THZRAIL, WOODRAIL, etc.) on FOFs. It doesn't work
      for that, because the railings use a different kind of transparency and software mode
      won't draw them on FOFs. So this one is going on the list of useless effects, right next
      to linetype <a href="#l104">104</a>.</p>
<!--Exact FOF flags:
FF_EXISTS|FF_SOLID|FF_RENDERSIDES|FF_NOSHADE|FF_CUTLEVEL-->
      <h3><a name="l104"></a>104 - Floor Over Floor: Solid, No Sides</h3>
      <p>Like a 3D floor of type <a href="#l101">101</a>, except that sides are not drawn.
      Supposedly a little bit faster than a normal 3D floor. You can use it when the sides
      wouldn't be visible anyway.</p>
      <p>This type of 3D floor will have shadows if and only if you set the control linedef's <a

      sector's floor or steps in the sector (depending on the sector special used). The linedef
      executor will keep being triggered over and over again as long as a player is there, hence
      the word &quot;continuous&quot; in this linetype's name. Tagged sector must have one of
      the <a href="#sCat2">Trigger Linedef Executor</a> types for this to work.</p>
      <h3><a name="l301"></a>301 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Each Time)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, except that it only gets triggered once for each time you
      fall or jump onto the floor. Tagged sector must have one of the <a href="#sCat2">Trigger
      Linedef Executor</a> types for this to work.</p>
      <h3><a name="l302"></a>302 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Once)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, except that after that linedef executor executes its
      linedefs, it's done. It's over. The linedefs will never be executed again.</p>
      <h3><a name="l303"></a>303 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Ring Count - Continuous)</h3>
      <p>Triggers linedef executor in the control sector when a player touches the tagged
      sector's floor or steps in the sector (depending on the sector special used). The linedef
      executor will keep being triggered over and over again as long as a player is there, hence
      the word &quot;continuous&quot; in this linetype's name. Tagged sector must have one of
      the <a href="#sCat2">Trigger Linedef Executor</a> types for this to work. Executor will be
      triggered depending on how many rings the player has:</p>
      <p>No flags -&gt; Runs if (rings = line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> -&gt; Runs if (rings &lt;= line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> -&gt; Runs if (rings &gt;= line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> -&gt; Takes the rings of ALL players into account.</p>
      <h3><a name="l304"></a>304 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Ring Count - Once)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l303">303</a>, except that after that linedef executor executes its
      linedefs, it's done. It's over. The linedefs will never be executed again.</p>
      <h3><a name="l305"></a>305 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Character Ability - Once)</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l302">302</a>, but is only activated when the character's
      ability number matches the linedef length by multiples of 10. For example:</p>
      <p>0-9 = Charability 0</p>
      <p>10-19 = Charability 1</p>
      <p>20-29 = Charability 2</p>
      <p>etc...</p>
      <h3><a name="l306"></a>306 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Character Ability - Continuous)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, but only triggers when the character's ability number
      matches the linedef length by multiples of 10. See linetype <a href="#l305">305</a> for a
      futher description.</p>
      <h3><a name="l307"></a>307 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Character Ability - Each Time)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l301">301</a>, but only triggers when the character's ability number
      matches the linedef length by multiples of 10. See linetype <a href="#l305">305</a> for a
      futher description.</p>
      <h3><a name="l308"></a>308 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Race Only, Once)</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l302">302</a>, but is only activated when the gametype is Race.
      Useful for doing things like opening doors, pre-solving puzzles, etc. to make race
      smoother.</p>
      <h3><a name="l309"></a>309 - Trigger Linedef Executor (CTF Red Team - Continuous)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, but only triggers if you are in CTF and on the red team.</p>
      <h3><a name="l310"></a>310 - Trigger Linedef Executor (CTF Red Team - Each Time)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l301">301</a>, but only triggers if you are in CTF and on the red team.</p>
      <h3><a name="l311"></a>311 - Trigger Linedef Executor (CTF Blue Team - Continuous)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, but only triggers if you are in CTF and on the blue team.</p>
      <h3><a name="l312"></a>312 - Trigger Linedef Executor (CTF Blue Team - Each Time)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l301">301</a>, but only triggers if you are in CTF and on the blue team.</p>
      <h3><a name="l313"></a>313 - Trigger Linedef Executor (No More Enemies - Once)</h3>
      <p>Like linetype <a href="#l302">302</a>, but is only activated when no more objects of
      type MF_ENEMY exist in its tagged area. Think &quot;destroy all enemies in this room for
      the door to open to go to the next room&quot;. Tag this to a control sector. It will go
      through the lines of the control sector, checking for any lines of type <a href="#l223">223</a>
      and checking inside the area occupied by the invisible intangible FOF to see if any
      enemies exist. If no alive enemies are in all of the type <a href="#l223">223</a> FOFs,
      the linedef executor is run once. The line length is the tag number of the linedef
      executor trigger to run.</p>
      <h3><a name="l314"></a>314 - Trigger Linedef Executor (# of Pushables - Continuous)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l300">300</a>, but only triggers if the number of pushable objects in
      the sector compared to the line length is:</p>
      <p>No flags -&gt; Runs if (# pushables = line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> -&gt; Runs if (# pushables &gt;= line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> -&gt; Runs if (# pushables &lt; line length)</p>
      <h3><a name="l315"></a>315 - Trigger Linedef Executor (# of Pushables - Once)</h3>
      <p>Like <a href="#l314">314</a>, but only triggers once.</p>
      <h3><a name="l316"></a>316 - Trigger Linedef Executor (PolyObject - Land On)</h3>
      <p>This will trigger every time you land on the polyobject. Line's tag # is 32000 + the
      PolyObject ID #. You must also flag the PolyObject Start (#20) line with <a
      href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> to tell the game it has a linedef executor associated with it.</p>
      <p>So if you had a PolyObject with an ID of 1, this line would have a tag of 32001.</p>

      <h3><a name="l400"></a>400 - Linedef Executor: Set Tagged Sector's Floor Height/Pic</h3>
      <p>When executed, instantly changes the tagged sector's floor height and flat to the floor
      height and flat of the linedef's front sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l401"></a>401 - Linedef Executor: Set Tagged Sector's Ceiling Height/Pic</h3>
      <p>When executed, instantly changes the tagged sector's ceiling height and flat to the
      ceiling height and flat of the linedef's front sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l402"></a>402 - Linedef Executor: Set Tagged Sector's Light Level</h3>
      <p>When executed, instantly changes the tagged sector's light level to that of the
      linedef's front sector. Floor and ceiling light settings done with linetypes <a
      href="#l601">601</a> and <a href="#l600">600</a> are transferred as well; colormaps are
      not.</p>
      <p>If there is a lighting effect active in the target sector or sectors at the time (glow,
      fade, strobe, flicker), it will be stopped.</p>
      <h3><a name="l403"></a>403 - Linedef Executor: Move Tagged Sector's Floor</h3>
      <p>When executed, starts moving the tagged sector's floor until it is at the same height
      as the linedef's front sector's floor. Speed is indicated in the same units used by
      linetype <a href="#l60">60</a>.</p>
      <p>If the line used has <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the floor flat will change
      after the move, to that on the front sector's floor. This is like what linetype <a
      href="#l400">400</a> does.</p>
      <p>If the line used has <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag, another linedef
      executor will be run when the floor movement is finished. (If multiple sectors finish at
      different times, it goes by the lowest numbered sector, but you should probably try to
      avoid this scenario.) The tag of the new linedef executor to run is specified by the X
      alignment on the front side of the line. The tag number you use must be positive, and this
      functionality cannot be combined with changing the floor flat using the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a>
      flag. Running a linedef executor will take precedence over changing the floor flat.</p>
      <h3><a name="l404"></a>404 - Linedef Executor: Move Tagged Sector's Ceiling</h3>
      <p>When executed, starts moving the tagged sector's ceiling until it is at the same height
      as the linedef's front sector's ceiling. Speed is indicated in the same units used by
      linetype <a href="#l60">60</a>.</p>
      <p>If the line used has <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the ceiling flat will change
      after the move, to that on the front sector's ceiling. This is like what linetype <a
      href="#l401">401</a> does.</p>
      <p>If the line used has <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag, another linedef
      executor will be run when the ceiling movement is finished. (If multiple sectors finish at
      different times, it goes by the lowest numbered sector, but you should probably try to
      avoid this scenario.) The tag of the new linedef executor to run is specified by the X
      alignment on the front side of the line. The tag number you use must be positive, and this
      functionality cannot be combined with changing the ceiling flat using the <a

      <h3><a name="l409"></a>409 - Linedef Executor: Change Calling Sector's Tag</h3>
      <p>Changes the tag of the calling sector; that is, the sector on the map that activated
      this linedef executor. The new tag is the linedef's length.</p>
      <h3><a name="l410"></a>410 - Linedef Executor: Change Front Sector's Tag</h3>
      <p>Changes the tag of the linedef's front sector. The new tag is the linedef's length.</p>
      <h3><a name="l411"></a>411 - Linedef Executor: Stop Plane Movement</h3>
      <p>Stops any and all floor, ceiling, or elevator movement in the tagged sector or sectors.</p>
      <h2><a name="l412"></a>412 - Linedef Executor: Teleport Player to Tagged Sector</h2>
      <p>The player who triggered the linedef executor will be teleported to the tagged sector.
      The player's exact X, Y, Z, and angle are determined by a teleport destination thing, type
      <a href="#t751">751</a>, somewhere in the tagged sector.</p>
      <p>If the <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> flag is used, it won't flash and make
      the teleport sound effects. If the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is used, it won't
      reset the angle to the angle of the teleport destination thing, and if the <a
      href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a> flag is used, it will not kill your acceleration/speed upon
      teleport.</p>
      <h2><a name="l413"></a>413 - Linedef Executor: Change Music</h2>
      <p>Linedef length indicates the music slot to use. If the linedef's <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a>
      flag is set, play the music once, otherwise loop it.</p>
      <p>If the player dies and goes back to a starpost, the beginning of the level, or the
      appropriate multiplayer start, the map music from before will be restored. The linedef
      flag <a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> can be set to change this behavior, and
      retain the new music even after dying.</p>
      <p>If the linedef length isn't a valid music slot, the music is stopped.</p>
      <h3><a name="l414"></a>414 - Linedef Executor: Play SFX</h3>
      <p>Plays a sound effect. The line length is the sound number to use. The list of sound
      effects can be found in sounds.h. The origin of the sound depends on which linedef flags
      are set: <ul>
        <li><a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> : The sound is played from nowhere, but only for the
          player who triggered it.</li>
        <li><a href="#EFFECT4">EFFECT4</a>: The sound is played from nowhere for everyone.</li>
        <li><a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a>: The sound is played from the center of the
          sector that triggered the linedef executor.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Otherwise, the sound is played from the location of the player or thing who triggered
      it.</p>
      <h3><a name="l415"></a>415 - Linedef Executor: Run Script</h3>
      <p>Runs a script, the same kind of script you can run on level load with the level header
      scriptname attribute. The script that will be run should have a lumpname of the form SCR<i>xxyyy</i>,
      where <i>xx</i> is the two-digit map number and <i>yyy</i> is the linedef's sector's floor
      height in decimal, with leading zeroes as necessary (or 000 if the floor height exceeds
      999 fracunits). For instance, if the linedef is in MAP31 and the floor of its sector is
      337 fracunits, the script named SCR31337 will be run.</p>
      <h3><a name="l416"></a>416 - Linedef Executor: Start Adjustable Fire Flicker</h3>
      <p>Essentially a copy of linetype <a href="#l603">603</a> that waits to activate until the
      linedef executor is triggered. It does have an extra feature, though. If you use a
      two-sided linedef with the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the linedef's back sector
      will be used as the maximum light level, allowing you to set the target sector (or
      sectors) at a different starting light level entirely.</p>
      <h3><a name="l417"></a>417 - Linedef Executor: Start Adjustable Glowing Light</h3>
      <p>Essentially a copy of linetype <a href="#l602">602</a> that waits to activate until the
      linedef executor is triggered. It does have an extra feature, though. If you use a
      two-sided linedef with the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the linedef's back sector
      will be used as the maximum light level, allowing you to set the target sector (or
      sectors) at a different starting light level entirely.</p>
      <h3><a name="l418"></a>418 - Linedef Executor: Start Adjustable Blinking Light
      (unsynchronized)</h3>
      <p>Essentially a copy of linetype <a href="#l604">604</a> that waits to activate until the
      linedef executor is triggered. It does have an extra feature, though. If you use a
      two-sided linedef with the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the linedef's back sector
      will be used as the maximum light level, allowing you to set the target sector (or
      sectors) at a different starting light level entirely.</p>
      <h3><a name="l419"></a>419 - Linedef Executor: Start Adjustable Blinking Light
      (synchronized)</h3>
      <p>Essentially a copy of linetype <a href="#l605">605</a> that waits to activate until the
      linedef executor is triggered. It does have an extra feature, though. If you use a
      two-sided linedef with the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, the linedef's back sector
      will be used as the maximum light level, allowing you to set the target sector (or
      sectors) at a different starting light level entirely.</p>
      <h3><a name="l420"></a>420 - Linedef Executor: Fade Light Level</h3>
      <p>When executed, gradually fades the tagged sector's light level to that of the linedef's
      front sector. Floor and ceiling light settings done with linetypes <a href="#l601">601</a>
      and <a href="#l600">600</a> are not affected or used.</p>
      <p>If there is a lighting effect already active in the target sector or sectors at the
      time (glow, other fade, strobe, flicker), it will be halted in favor of this one.</p>
      <p>Linedef length in fracunits indicates speed. Fading from 224 to 64 with a linedef
      length of 4 will take 40 fracunits (224 - 64 = 160, 160 / 4 = 40). There are 35 fracunits
      in a second.</p>
      <h3><a name="l421"></a>421 - Linedef Executor: Stop Lighting Effect</h3>
      <p>Stops any lighting effects active in the tagged sector or sectors: glow, fade, strobe,
      flicker, etc. The light level, whatever it is at the moment this script line is run, will
      be preserved until a new lighting effect or light level change is used.</p>
      <p>Note that the lighting effects will all stop other lighting effects when activated. In
      other words, you only need to use this when you really want the lighting effect to stop,
      not when you want one effect to stop and another to start.</p>
      <h3><a name="l422"></a>422 - Linedef Executor: Cut-Away View</h3>
      <p>Cuts away to a view from a different place for a moment. Only works for linedef
      executors triggered by a player. Tag the line to a sector with an alt view thing (map
      thing type 5007) in it at the proper location with the proper Z and angle. The line length
      indicates how long to stay in this view, in tics.</p>
      <p>By giving the linedef a <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag, you can adjust the
      vertical viewing angle from the cut-away view. Set the x offset on the linedef's front
      side to an integer -90 to 90. In software mode the range of viewing angles is actually
      about -68 to 68. This is in degrees.</p>
      <h3><a name="l423"></a>423 - Linedef Executor: Change Sky</h3>
      <p>Changes sky to the # of the control sector's floorheight. This only affects the player
      who activates it. If you'd like it to affect all players, make sure you check the <a
      href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag.</p>
      <h3><a name="l424"></a>424 - Linedef Executor: Change Weather</h3>
      <p>Changes weather to the control sector's floorheight in powers of 10.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div align="left"><table border="1" width="28%">
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">Linedef Length</td>
          <td width="50%">Weather Type</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">10</td>
          <td width="50%">None</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">20</td>
          <td width="50%">Snow</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">30</td>
          <td width="50%">Rain</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td width="50%">40</td>
          <td width="50%">Storm</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      </div><p>(higher numbers reserved for future use)</p>
      <p>This only affects the player who activates it. If you'd like it to affect all players,
      make sure you check the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag.</p>
      <h3><a name="l425"></a>425 - Linedef Executor: Change Object State</h3>
      <p>Changes the animation frame of the activating object to the state # indicated by the
      length of the control linedef. Be careful how you use this.</p>
      <h3><a name="l426"></a>426 - Linedef Executor: Stop Object</h3>
      <p>Makes the object that triggered the linedef executor stop moving, after being sent to
      the center of the sector it's in (only if <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is set), on
      the floor. Although it comes to a complete stop, the object can begin moving right away
      again. If the object is a player, the player will stop jumping, spinning, or anything
      else.</p>
      <h3><a name="l427"></a>427 - Linedef Executor: Award Score</h3>
      <p>Adds to the score of the player who activated it. Control sector's floorheight = points
      to award. This even works with negative values.</p>
      <h3><a name="l428"></a>428 - Linedef Executor: Start Platform Movement</h3>
      <p>Starts a moving platform in the nature of linetype <a href="#l59">59</a> or <a
      href="#l60">60</a>. If the <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is set, the platform will
      begin moving upwards. Otherwise, it will start moving downwards. Speed of movement is set
      just like with linetype <a href="#l60">60</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="l429"></a>429 - Linedef Executor: Crush Ceiling Once</h3>
      <p>Ceiling moves down to the floor, then back up. Speed is determined by line length -
      every 16 units equals 1 FRACUNIT/tic.</p>
      <h3><a name="l430"></a>430 - Linedef Executor: Crush Floor Once</h3>
      <p>Floor moves up to the ceiling, then back down. Speed is determined by line length -
      every 16 units equals 1 FRACUNIT/tic.</p>
      <h3><a name="l431"></a>431 - Linedef Executor: Crush Floor And Ceiling Once</h3>
      <p>Floor and ceiling meet in the middle and then return, sandwiching anything that's
      inbetween. Speed is determined by line length - every 16 units equals 1 FRACUNIT/tic.</p>
      <h3><a name="l432"></a>432 - Linedef Executor: Enable 2D Mode</h3>
      <p>Turns on 2D mode within the level. You'll probably only want to use this with a zoom
      tube or teleport to guarantee that the player is in the correct position when it switches.</p>
      <h3><a name="l433"></a>433 - Linedef Executor: Disable 2D Mode</h3>
      <p>Turns off 2D mode within the level.</p>
      <h3><a name="l434"></a>434 - Linedef Executor: Award Custom Power</h3>
      <p>Awards (or removes!) a power to the calling player.</p>
      <p>X length: Power Index + 1</p>
      <p>Y length: Power Duration (in 35ths of a second)</p>
      <h3><a name="l435"></a>435 - Linedef Executor: Change Scroller Direction</h3>
      <p>Changes direction of a scroller (conveyor, texture). Also changes speed if this is not
      an accelerative/displacement scroller.</p>
      <h3><a name="l436"></a>436 - Linedef Executor: Shatter Block</h3>
      <p>Shatters a FOF - of any type. Parameters are as follows:</p>
      <p>Texture X Offset: Tag # of FOF target sector</p>
      <p>Texture Y Offset: Tag # of FOF control sector</p>
      <p>Note that the FOF should only have one target sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="l437"></a>437 - Linedef Executor: Disable Player Control</h3>
      <p>Disables the controls of the player that triggered the linedef executor. If the
      <a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> flag is set, they will be able to jump, however.</p>
      <p>Giving the front texture of the linedef an X offset will make the effect last that amount
      of time, in tics.  Otherwise, it ends immediately, so you would need to use a continuous
      trigger.</p>
      <h3><a name="l438"></a>438 - Linedef Executor: Set Object's Scale</h3>
      <p>Length of this line determines the scale size of an object, in percentage. Note that there is a max of 400%.</p>
      <h3><a name="l450"></a>450 - Linedef Executor: Execute Linedef Executor</h3>
      <p>Just what it says. Can be used for recursion. Be careful, because you CAN make a loop
      out of this that will freeze the game.</p>
      <p>Tag is the linedef executor trigger tag to run.</p>
      <h3><a name="l488"></a>488 - Linedef Executor: PolyObject - Move by Waypoints</h3>
      <p>Moves a polyobject along a sequence of Zoom Tube waypoints.</p>
      <p>Texture X offset: Speed (8 = 1 FRACUNIT).</p>
      <p>Texture Y offset: Sequence # of Zoom Tube waypoints.</p>
      <p>The movement also depends on which linedef flags are set: <ul>
        <li><a href="#EFFECT1">EFFECT1</a> : Moves from highest waypoint # to lowest waypoint #.</li>
        <li><a href="#EFFECT2">EFFECT2</a> : Comes back the way it came when the end is reached.</li>
        <li><a href="#EFFECT3">EFFECT3</a> : Wrap around the waypoints.</li>

      <p>If you want friction on a FOF, tag this line to the control sector of the FOF.
      Otherwise, tag it to the sector of desired destination.</p>
      <h3><a name="l541"></a>541 - Wind</h3>
      <p>Speed and direction are indicated by linedef length and direction. The target sector
      should be of type <a href="#s512">512</a>, Wind/Current. If being used in a 3D Floor, put

      <h3><a name="l542"></a>542 - Upwards Wind</h3>
      <p>The length of the linedef is the wind speed. The target sector will need type <a

      <p>Creates a &quot;point pusher,&quot; or a point that pushes you away or pulls you toward
      it if you get close enough. Tag the linedef to a sector with type <a href="#s512">512</a>,
      Wind/Current, and with a thing on it of type 5001 (push) or 5002 (pull). The control
      linedef's length indicates pushing/pulling strength; if length is L, the effect fades away
      to nothing when you are 2L away from the point.</p>
      <p>If you want to create multiple point pushers/pullers, you'll need to have them in
      different target sectors, but they can share the same tag.</p>

      <h3><a name="l600"></a>600 - Floor Lighting</h3>
      <p>Sets the lighting for the floor only. The control sector's light value will be used for

      <h3><a name="l601"></a>601 - Ceiling Lighting</h3>
      <p>Sets the lighting of the ceiling only. The light value of the control sector will be
      used for the target sector's ceiling. Also see type <a href="#l600">600</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="l602"></a>602 - Adjustable Pulsating Light</h3>
      <p>Linedef length indicates glow speed. The normal speed would be a linedef 32 units long.</p>
      <p>The control sector (the linedef's front sector) is used to get what will be the minimum
      light level for this effect, while the target sector's light level ends up being the
      maximum.</p>
      <h3><a name="l603"></a>603 - Adjustable Flickering Light</h3>
      <p>Linedef length indicates flicker speed. Normal speed would be a 16 fracunit long
      linedef. A longer linedef means more time in between flickers.</p>
      <p>The control sector (the linedef's front sector) is used to get what will be the minimum
      light level for this effect, while the target sector's light level ends up being the
      maximum.</p>
      <h3><a name="l604"></a>604 - Adjustable Blinking Light (unsynchronized)</h3>
      <p>Line's X length is time for the light to be off, and Y length is the time for the light
      to be on.</p>
      <p>The control sector (the linedef's front sector) is used to get what will be the minimum
      light level for this effect, while the target sector's light level ends up being the

      <h3><a name="l606"></a>606 - Colormap</h3>
      <p>Sets a colormap. Tag the linedef to the sector or sectors affected by the colormap. The
      control linedef's front Above texture is used to determine the colormap. The format is
      #rrggbba, where rr, gg, and bb are two hexadecimal digits for determining each color: red,
      blue, and green. The a stands for alpha, and is a number or letter indicating the
      translucency; from A-Z and 0-9, with A being most transparent and 9 being most opaque.</p>
      <p>It does not generally matter what sector the colormap linedef belongs to. However, it
      should not belong to the same sector as another colormap, as this can cause problems.</p>

  <h1><a name="sectortypes"></a>Sector Types</h1>
  <p>You can apply up to four different types to one sector, provided that you only choose
  ONE from EACH category. Add the numbers together to obtain the final value to use in level
  editors.</p>
  <li><u><big><big>Section 1</big></big></u><ol>
      <h3><a name="s1"></a>1 - Damage (Generic)</h3>
      <p>This special hurts, period. It doesn't matter whether you have a liquid shield, fire
      shield, attraction shield, or whatever else; step on one of these and suffer.</p>
      <h3><a name="s2"></a>2 - Damage (Water)</h3>
      <p>Also known as Slime Hurt. Stepping here will be painful, as in shield/ring/life loss
      (depending on how you are equipped), unless you happen to have the liquid shield.</p>
      <h3><a name="s3"></a>3 - Damage (Fire)</h3>
      <p>Stepping here will hurt, unless you happen to have a fire shield.</p>
      <h3><a name="s4"></a>4 - Damage (Electrical)</h3>
      <p>Hurts players whenever they're in the sector, unless they have the attraction shield.</p>
      <p>Usage tip: Give the sector a floor flat that looks electrical and looks like it could
      hurt you. </p>
      <h3><a name="s5"></a>5 - Spikes</h3>
      <p>Making spikes using sectors is rather tedious and difficult. You can use things instead
      (<a href="#t523">Floor Spike</a> and <a href="#t522">Ceiling Spike</a>). But the sector
      version DOES look cooler. ;)</p>
      <h3><a name="s6"></a>6 - Death Pit (Camera Modifications)</h3>
      <p>Used for bottomless pits. You'll probably want the sector's floor flat to be either
      F_SKY1 (falling from the sky) or PIT (falling into a pit of complete blackness). The
      camera modifications keep the camera from following you all the way down, for a Sonic
      Adventure-style pit death. If you don't like the camera modifications, use sector type <a
      href="#s7">5</a>.</p>
      <h3><a name="s7"></a>7 - Death Pit (No Camera Modifications)</h3>
      <p>For bottomless pits. Use if the camera modifications of sector type <a href="#s6">6</a>
      are not to your taste.</p>
      <h3><a name="s8"></a>8 - Instant Kill</h3>
      <p>Die right away if you even step into this sector. No need to touch the floor as with
      those sissy death pits.</p>
      <h3><a name="s9"></a>9 - Ring Drainer (Floor Touch)</h3>
      <p>Lose one ring per 15 tics while touching the floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="s10"></a>10 - Ring Drainer (No Floor Touch)</h3>
      <p>Like sector type <a href="#s9">9</a>, but doesn't require touching floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="s11"></a>11 - Special Stage Damage</h3>
      <p>If you have rings and no shield, and you step on it, you only lose 10 rings, maximum.
      It's just like the special stages!</p>
      <h3><a name="s12"></a>12 - Space Countdown</h3>
      <p>In space, you have no chance to survive make your time, ha ha ha. Starts an immediate
      five-second countdown, like when you drown.</p>
      <h3><a name="s13"></a>13 - Ramp Sector</h3>
      <p>Doubles the step-up height of the player. Default step-up height is 24 fracunits, but
      with this, it becomes 48. Useful for steps and other things if your players seem to be
      getting 'stopped' by the stairs while moving quickly.</p>
      <h3><a name="s14"></a>14 - Non-Ramp Sector (Don't step down)</h3>
      <p>Removes the 'step-down' that a player will normally do when moving to a nearby sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="s15"></a>15 - Bouncy Sector (FOF Control Only)</h3>
      <p>Use this on a 3D floor's control sector to make it bouncy. Players will bounce off the
      top of it. If the 3D floor's control line has the BOUNCY flag set, the linedef length sets
      the minimum bounce force. Otherwise, you will slowly come to a stop.</p>

      <p>Works like <a href="#s80">80</a> but with a pushable object (gargoyle or snowman)
      touching the floor rather than a player.</p>
      <h3><a name="s32"></a>32 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Anywhere in Sector) (All Players)</h3>
      <p>Sector type <a href="#s64">64</a> with the added requirement that all players who don't

      FOFs.</p>
      <h3><a name="s48"></a>48 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Floor Touch) (All Players)</h3>

      <h3><a name="s64"></a>64 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Anywhere in Sector)</h3>
      <p>Like sector type <a href="#s80">80</a>, but you don't have to be touching the floor to
      do the triggering. You could be flying high in the air. You should also use this one for
      linedef executors triggered by FOFs.</p>
      <h3><a name="s80"></a>80 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Floor Touch)</h3>
      <p>Required for any of the <a href="#ltriggers">Linedef Executor Triggers</a> to work in
      the sector.</p>
      <h3><a name="s96"></a>96 - Trigger Linedef Executor (Emerald Check)</h3>
      <p>Sector type <a href="#s64">64</a> which will only execute if you have all 7 chaos
      emeralds.</p>
      <h3><a name="s112"></a>112 - Trigger Linedef Executor (NiGHTS Mare)</h3>
      <p>Like sector type <a href="#s64">64</a>, but this is only triggered if you are in a
      NiGHTS map, and checks what mare you're on using the following format, depending on what
      flags you have set for this line:</p>
      <p>No flags -&gt; Runs if (current mare = line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#NOCLIMB">NOCLIMB</a> -&gt; Runs if (current mare &lt;= line length)</p>
      <p><a href="#BLOCKMONSTERS">BLOCKMONSTERS</a> -&gt; Runs if (current mare &gt;= line
      length)</p>
      <h3><a name="s128"></a>128 - Check for linedef executor on 3D Floors (ANY object)</h3>
      <p>For any item to detect sector type <a href="#l16">16</a> on a 3D floor, the target
      sector on the map must have this type. This allows you to have any kind of object trigger
      a linedef executor.</p>
      <h3><a name="s144"></a>144 - Egg Trap Capsule</h3>
      <h3><a name="s160"></a>160 - Special Stage Time/Rings, Par</h3>
      <p>For special stages, floor height is time limit in seconds, and ceiling height is rings
      required in seconds. If the ceiling height is 0, there is no ring requirement, only a time
      limit to find an exit.</p>
      <h3><a name="s176"></a>176 - Custom Global Gravity</h3>
      <p>Floor height sets global gravity. 500 is normal. 1000 is twice the normal gravity, 250
      is half. You can also set per-sector gravity with linetype <a href="#l1">1</a>. This can
      also be adjusted in realtime, for some really cool effects.</p>

      <h3><a name="s1536"></a>1536 - Speed Pad (Spin)</h3>
      <p>See linedef type <a href="#l4">4</a>. This type of speed pad forces you into a spin.</p>

      <h3><a name="s4096"></a>4096 - Starpost Activator</h3>
      <p>Whenever a player steps in the sector, a starpost in that sector will be searched for
      and, if found, activated.</p>
      <h3><a name="s8192"></a>8192 - Special Stage Goal</h3>
      <p>This is like the &quot;GOAL&quot; buttons in Sonic 1's special stages. Ends the special
      stage when stepped on.</p>
      <h3><a name="s8192a"></a>8192 - Exit Sector</h3>
      <p>In single-player, cooperative, or race mode, being in this sector ends the level. You
      don't necessarily have to be touching the floor. (If you want the player to have to be
      touching the floor, you can use linedef type <a href="#l223">223</a>, an invisible,
      intangible FOF, to do the trick. Give the FOF control sector a type of <a href="#s8192">8192</a>.)</p>
      <p>See linedef type <a href="#l2">2</a> for a way to exit to any map, not just the one
      whose number is specified in the map header. Linedef 2 also allows you to skip the score
      tally screen.</p>
      <h3><a name="s8192b"></a>8192 - No Tag Zone</h3>
      <p>In games of tag, this sector is a safe spot. You cannot be tagged while in it.</p>
      <h3><a name="s8192c"></a>8192 - CTF: Flag Return</h3>
      <p>In CTF, if the red or blue flag enters this sector, it will automatically return to
      base, much like how it behaves when it falls in a pit. This can also be set as a special
      on a 3D floor.</p>
      <h3><a name="s12288"></a>12288 - CTF: Red Team Base</h3>
      <p>The red team has to bring the <a href="#t307">blue flag</a> onto this sector to score.
      It's generally a good idea to have the <a href="#t306">red flag</a> here and the <a
      href="#t34">red team player starts</a> somewhere close by.</p>
      <h3><a name="s16384"></a>16384 - CTF: Blue Team Base</h3>
      <p>The blue team has to bring the <a href="#t306">red flag</a> onto this sector to score.
      It's generally a good idea to have the <a href="#t307">blue flag</a> here and the <a
      href="#t35">blue team player starts</a> somewhere close by.</p>
      <h3><a name="s20480"></a>20480 - Fan Sector</h3>
      <p>Acts like a fan, pushing the player up at constant speed and activating the proper
      animation. Can be used on intangible FOFs.</p>
      <h3><a name="s24576"></a>24576 - Super Sonic Transform</h3>
      <p>Transforms you into Super Sonic and gives you 50 rings, providing you have all of the
      chaos emeralds.</p>
      <h3><a name="s28672"></a>28672 - Spinner</h3>
      <p>Forces the player into a spin.</p>
      <h3><a name="s32768"></a>32768 - Zoom Tube Start</h3>
      <p>When the player touches this sector, a line type <a href="#l3">3</a> with the same tag
      as the sector is searched for, and if found, the line's X length determines the speed at
      which the tube operates, while its Y length determines which zoom tube sequence to use.
      Then the player is immediately put into a spin, loses control, and gravitates toward the
      first Zoom Tube Waypoint (thing type <a href="#t753">753</a>), which does not have to be
      in the same sector. Once they reach the first waypoint, they begin traveling to the 2nd,
      3rd, and so on, until the last waypoint is reached.</p>
      <p>This can be used with Floor-Over-Floors, just use these specials in the control sector
      instead. </p>
      <h3><a name="s36864"></a>36864 - Zoom Tube End</h3>
      <p>Just like sector type <a href="#s32768">32768</a>, but starts from the last waypoint
      and goes to the first.</p>
      <h3><a name="s40960"></a>40960 - Finish Line</h3>
      <p>The finish line for a race circuit. This increments a lap when you pass it, after
      hitting all the star posts in the stage in sequential order. Once the number of laps
      specified by the server is reached, the level is completed.</p>
