/* TEXTURES AND FLAT SOURCES ---------------------------------------------------

This tells Doom Builder where to find the information for textures and flats in
the IWAD file, Addition WAD file and Map WAD file.

Start and end lumps must be given in a structure (of which the key name doesn't
matter) and any textures or flats in between them are loaded in either the
textures category or flats category.

For textures: PNAMES, TEXTURE1 and TEXTURE2 are loaded by default.

// Flat sources.

		start = "FF_START";
		end = "F_END";
	}

	standard4
	{
		start = "F_START";
		end = "FF_END";
	}
}

/* TEXTURES AND FLATS FILTERING ------------------------------------------------

This allows you to filter textures and flats so that you only see the
textures/flats listed that you prefer to use.

The key name doesn't matter here, only the values.

Pattern-matching is performed on lump names. You can use the following wildcards
in values to specify ranges:

? = Any character.
* = Zero or more characters.
# = Any numeric digit.
[abc...] = Any of these characters that are between brackets.
[!abc..] = Not any of these characters that are between brackets.

*/

// List these textures...
texturesfilter
{
	all_textures = "*";
}

// But do not list these textures...
notexturesfilter
{
	none = "";
}

// List these flats...
flatsfilter
{
	all_flats = "*";
}

// But do not list these flats...
noflatsfilter
{
	none = "";
}

/* PSEUDO-FLATS AND TEXTURES ---------------------------------------------------

Names of flats and textures that don't really exist, but shouldn't be identified
as invalid.

Pattern-matching is performed on lump names. See above for syntax.

/* MAP LUMP NAMES --------------------------------------------------------------

Map lumps are loaded with the map as long as they are right after each other.
When the editor meets a lump which is not defined in this list (or defined
as 0), it will stop loading right there.

The order of items defines the order in which lumps will be written to WAD file
on save. The value (flags) of items determines what the editor should do with
it. You should never mess with value 4, because it may result in incorrect map
builds.

    1 = Lump required.
    2 = Lump which must be respected.
    4 = Lump generated by node builder.
    8 = Lump allowed to be empty after nodebuilding.
   16 = Lump allowed to be missing after nodebuilding.
 4096 = Lump which can be edited as text.
 8192 = Lump which can be edited as DEHACKED.
12288 = Lump which can be edited as MAPINFO.
16384 = WAD-global.

This is a hack. The FOF flag values have changed in 2.0, but the old 1.09.4
values are hardcoded in the source for SRB2 Doom Builder. Until Oogaland fixes
this, I'm sticking some fake values in here to make 3D mode draw FOFs like it's
supposed to. --Neo

Flags I've found relevant:

 4 = Renders the walls.
 8 = Renders the planes.
32 = Doesn't cast a shadow.
